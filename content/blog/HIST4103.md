## Description

This seminar brings together students from the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) with students from Computer Science (CS) to address critical questions at the intersection of digital technologies and our common humanity. Students will form multidisciplinary teams to tackle problems of common interest. How is the development of Artificial Intelligence shaped by histories of technology, race, gender, and colonialism? How can digital tools be used to analyze critical questions? Students will learn data visualization tools and discuss the interaction of computing in society, from the past to the present. No technical skills or HSS experience required.
