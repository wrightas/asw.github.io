## Description

I was very happy to present some of my experience teaching Computing and Society in History at Dal at the Past/Future: African Canadian History, Arts, and Culture in STEM Education symposium, organized by Afua Cooper and the [A Black Peoples' History of Canada Project](https://www.blackpeopleshistory.ca/). My panel was moderated by Natasha Henry, and I was joined by Eddia Solas and Graham Nickerson.
