## Abstract

Penrose diagrams gave mid-twentieth century physicists studying General Relativity (GR) a new tool for understanding Einstein's theory of gravity. Starting in 1962 they allowed new understandings and conceptualizations of the mathematical objects of theoretical physics. One origin of the diagrams is found in Roger Penrose's engagement with the art of “impossible objects”. These new understandings contributed to the “renaissance” GR experienced starting in the late 1950s. By following the diagrams through the GR community, the interrelation of research and pedagogy is explicated. This interrelation rapidly disseminated the tools to new workers in the field, further amplifying the effect of this new theoretical tool on disciplinary growth.
