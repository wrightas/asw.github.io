## Description

Does technology drive history? Does it determine which people even have a history? Historians, after all, call the time before writing tools "prehistory." This course explores the relationship between technology and North American histories-histories of nations, of social classes, and of bodies. Topics include colonialism; indigenous history; feminist and women's history; industry and economy; mining; and biotechnology.
