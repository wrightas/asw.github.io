# About Me

I live in Halifax, NS, with my wife and son. Before coming to Halifax in 2018, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Suppes Center for History and Philosophy of Science at <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/dept/cisst/" title="Suppes Center">Stanford University</a>. Before that, I was Lecturer and a <a href="http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/" title="Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada">SSHRC</a> Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of History of Science at <a href="http://histsci.fas.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a>.  

I received my PhD from the Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Technology at the <a href="http://hps.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a> in 2014, also with support from SSHRC. As an undergraduate, I studied both physics and history in the BA&Sc program at <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca">McGill University</a>.  

I enjoy canoeing and photography. I have won one gold medal for downhill skiing (slalom). The medal is shaped like a chocolate bar.
